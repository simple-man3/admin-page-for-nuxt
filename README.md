### Information blocks
The Information block is a thematic content repository. <br>
For example.
Let's say we have a slider that displays slides of pictures.
We can create a "Slider" Information block and store the pictures themselves in it. <br>

Let's say we have several sliders. One slider on the main page, 
the second slider in another section, and the third is generally displayed on the user's page. <br>
Then it turns out we have a lot of messy content and if we have other content, such as news or articles. Information blocks come to the rescue. <br>
we can structure data on a specific basis.
We can create an Information block for sliders, calling it "Slider" and place content for sliders in it.<br>
At the moment the logic of Information block is implemented.
